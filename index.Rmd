**An Eco-educational initiative to make ecosystem data accessible, understood, and utilized.**

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a "continental-scale observation facility operated by Battelle and designed to collect long-term open access ecological data to better understand how U.S. ecosystems are changing."

Our goal is to make NEON data more easily accessible for students in the classroom. Under construction, you'll find our open-source code and coursework for learning quantitative ecosystem ecology.

Welcome!
